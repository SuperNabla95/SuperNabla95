Hi, 👋 I’m @SuperNabla95. Nice to meet you!  
I’m interested in information retrieval, big data, graph processing, and data compression techniques. 👀  
In my spare time, I love reading books 📖, cycling 🚴, and play videogames 🎮.
🌱 I’m currently a Ph.D. Student under the supervision of prof. Paolo Ferragina, and a member of the <a href="http://acube.di.unipi.it">Acube Laboratory</a>.
